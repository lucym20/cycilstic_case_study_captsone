# cycilstic_case_study_captsone
This is a collection of the data, analysis, and presentation I made as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project.

Thanks to Motivate International Inc, who operate the Divvy bicycle program in Chicago, for the data used to represent the fictional company 'Cyclistic' in this study.

Also thanks to https://github.com/isabellapeel who provided a wonderful and much more sophisticated example of this case study than I have achieved. 

Vizzes in the presentation were made in tableau, dashboard can be viewed here https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleAnalyticsCapstone/Sheet7?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
